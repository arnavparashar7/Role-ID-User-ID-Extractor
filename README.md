# Discord-Role-ID-User-ID-Extractor
Extracts the UserIDs and their names under a Specific Role in Discord.

Steps:-

1. Replace the Token ID with your Bot's Token
2. Replace the Role ID for the role you want the list.
3. Replace the Guild ID with server ID under which the role is.

Run the script and it will give out a csv file.
ENJOY!!!

*Discord.py is needed for this which can be installed by the command `pip install discord.py` in terminal if you already have python installed on you machine.
